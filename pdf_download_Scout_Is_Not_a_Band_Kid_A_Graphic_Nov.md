Overview
A young girl in middle school will do whatever it takes to meet her favorite authorâ€”even if it means joining her school band! A contemporary graphic novel about making your dream come trueâ€”and the friends you make along the way.

 When Scout learns that her favorite author is doing an exclusive autograph session at the end of the year, she&#039;s determined to be there! She officially needs a plan...and when she finds out that her school&#039;s band is heading to the same location for their annual trip, an idea takes shape. Being a band kid can&#039;t be that hard, right?

 As it turns out, learning how to play an instrument when you canâ€™t even read music is much, much, MUCH tougher than expected. And itâ€™s even harder for Scout when her friends arenâ€™t on board with her new hobby. Will she be able to master the trombone, make new band friends, and get to her favorite authorâ€™s book signing? Tackling everything seems like a challenge for a supergenius superfriend supermusicianâ€”and sheâ€™s just Scout.
