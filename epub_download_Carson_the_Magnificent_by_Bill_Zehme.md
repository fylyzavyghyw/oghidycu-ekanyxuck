A much-anticipated biography‚Äîtwenty years in the making‚Äîof the entertainer who redefined late-night television and reshaped American culture.
 
 In 2002, Bill Zehme landed one of the most coveted assignments for a magazine writer: an interview with Johnny Carson‚Äîthe only one he‚Äôd granted since retiring from hosting The Tonight Show a decade earlier. Zehme was tapped for the Esquire feature story thanks to his years of legendary celebrity profiles, and the resulting piece portrayed Carson as more human being than showbiz legend. Shortly after Carson‚Äôs death in 2005 and urged on by many of those closest to Carson, Zehme signed a contract to do an expansive biography. He toiled on the book for nearly a decade‚Äîinterviewing dozens of Carson‚Äôs colleagues and friends and filling up a storage locker with his voluminous research‚Äîbefore a cancer diagnosis and ongoing treatments halted his progress. When he died in 2023 his obituaries mentioned the Carson book, with New York Times comedy critic Jason Zinoman calling it ‚Äúone of the great unfinished biographies.‚Äù
 
 Yet the hundreds of pages Zehme managed to complete are astounding both for the caliber of their writing and how they illuminate one of the most inscrutable figures in entertainment history: A man who brought so much joy and laughter to so many millions but was himself exceedingly shy and private. Zehme traces Carson‚Äôs rise from a magic-obsessed Nebraska boy to a Navy ensign in World War II to a burgeoning radio and TV personality to, eventually, host of The Tonight Show‚Äîwhich he transformed, along with the entirety of American popular culture, over the next three decades. Without Carson, there would be no late-night television as we know it. On a much more intimate level, Zehme also captures the turmoil and anguish that accompanied the success: four marriages, troubles with alcohol, and the devastating loss of a child.
 
 In one passage, Zehme notes that when asked by an interviewer in the mid-80s for the secret to his success, Carson replied simply, ‚ÄúBe yourself and tell the truth.‚Äù Completed with help from journalist and Zehme‚Äôs former research assistant Mike Thomas, Carson the Magnificent offers just that: an honest assessment of who Johnny Carson really was.
