Overview
From the New York Times bestselling author of EVERY DAY, this is a queer love story for the agesâ€”told over the course of a couple&#039;s first ten dates.

 When a blue-haired boy (Ryan) meets a pink-haired boy (Avery) at a danceâ€”a queer promâ€”both feel an inexplicable but powerful connection. Follow them through their first ten dates as they bridge their initial shyness and fall in loveâ€”through snowstorms, groundings, meeting parents (Avery&#039;s) and not (Ryan&#039;s), cast parties, heartbreak, and every day and date in between.
