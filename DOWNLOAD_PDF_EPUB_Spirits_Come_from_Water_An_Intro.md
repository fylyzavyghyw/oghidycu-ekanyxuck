For those who wish to decolonize their minds, particularly Black women, comes a thoughtful guide to ancestral veneration, with a focus on the importance of reclaiming African Spiritual practices as an act of liberation.
 
 In today&amp;#039;s world, there&amp;#039;s a notable resurgence in spiritual exploration that diverges from the mainstream New Age culture. People are seeking clarity that aligns with their own ancestral lineage, and ancestral veneration has emerged as a powerful avenue to navigate life&amp;#039;s complexities. For Black communities, this resurgence represents a reclamation of hope for the diaspora.
 
 In this book, Ifa and Orisa priestess Ehime Ora shares the importance of connection to the ancestors, and to oneâ€™s spiritual roots. Thereâ€™s a certain type of radical healing that takes place when we reconnect to our ancestral veneration and follow through with their wisdom.
 
 Providing healing through the written word, Ehime walks you though the reclamation of African Spiritual practices, discussing the spiritual renaissance occurring in the African community, and includes interviews with elders of the rich traditions. She also provides tangible spiritual tools so that you can incorporate ancestral veneration in your life: how to properly set up and work with an ancestral altar, the importance of spiritual hygiene, and bringing forth the concept of the ori, or the higher self.
